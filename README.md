# Swim-Dragon
Removes Render Dragon from all versions (only works on windows 10/11 with RTX GPUs)
# Requirements
Windows 10 or 11, an RTX GPU, and Admin on your PC
# How it works
Modifies the NVIDIA driver profile for Minecraft to have the hidden setting "Ray Tracing - (DXR)" to be set to false.
<br>
This forces bedrock to use the old rendering engine, fixing all the performance issues resulting in making the game smoother and have higher FPS.
<br>
This even fixes pink glitch somehow.
